  abstract = {In a moment when the "value" of postsecondary education has been repeatedly called into question, this study responds by identifying long-term effects of the undergraduate experience with particular attention to the general education curriculum. Specifically, it draws on 559 written responses from a wide range of alumni to identify which elements of their undergraduate education are still most salient. Of these elements, coursework emerged as most important for alumni, who cited its contributions to their development of self-understanding, interpersonal skills, career preparation, and intellectual skills such as critical thinking. Alumni also indicated that perceptions of coursework shifted with time so that courses that did not seem useful at graduation ultimately provided valuable preparation for their lives and careers. In negative accounts, alumni described a lack of guidance through curricular requirements. This study demonstrates an approach that can yield more nuanced and complex information about the general education curriculum's long-term effects by including respondent writing as a supplement to the data gathered through closed-entry surveys. Analyzing what college alumni write about their undergraduate education proves not only to be a promising approach for understanding how to improve general education curricula more effectively, but to also further evidence for proclaiming the importance of general education.},

  abstract = {Online Writing Instruction (OWI) programs, like online learning classes in general, are becoming more popular in post-secondary education. Yet few articles discuss how to tailor course assessment methods to an exclusively online environment. This thesis explores video analytics as a possible course assessment tool for online writing classrooms. Video analytics allow instructors, course designers, and writing program administrators to view how many students are engaging in video-based course materials. Additionally, video analytics can provide information about how active students are in their data-finding methods while they watch. By means of example, this thesis examines video analytics from one semester of a large western university's online first-year writing sections (n=283). This study finds that video analytics afford stakeholders knowledge of patterns in how students interact with video-based course materials. Assuming the end goal of course assessment is to provide meaningful insight that will help improve student and teacher experience, video analytics can be a powerful, dynamic course assessment tool.},

To answer these questions, this study uses both quantitative and qualitative methods, utilizing a quasi-experimental, pre-test/post-test design by conducting an open comparison between the two pedagogy modules. Students scored significantly higher on the post-test in both designs and differences between the two increases weren't statistically significant, showing that both treatments are effective. Follow-up interviews explored the differences between treatments.},

We find that increases in writing coursework are associated with economically meaningful decreases in early career labor market outcomes, challenging claims that writing is a valuable skill in the labor market.}
