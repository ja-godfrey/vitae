\begin{rubric}{About Me}
	\entry*[]%
	As a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan, my studies and experiences have been uniquely geared towards understanding student debt. Specifically, as a Research Associate on a Mellon Foundation grant, I conducted research on the long-term effects of work and student debt on alumni. In addition to research on long-graduated individuals, my roles as instructor for undergraduates across all levels has further illuminated the pervasive impacts of debt. Furthermore, my service as Treasurer for the Rackham Student Government included organizing and distributing COVID-19 relief microgrants, underlining the critical difference that even modest relief efforts can make in students' lives. These experiences and others make me an asset to the Student Loan Relief Committee.
